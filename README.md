# State-efficient QFA algorithm for quantum computers

Responsible person: Ã–zlem Salehi (osalehi[at]iitis.pl).

The code necessary for running the experiments in the paper "State-efficient QFA Algorithm for Quantum Computers" is given here.

The code was tested under Windows. You should install Qiskit to be able to run the codes. In order to access IBMQ backends, you should create an account on https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/ and follow the instructions given [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/manage/account/ibmq). 

## Data used in the manuscript

Data used in the manuscript is located inside the data folder. 

## Reproducing data

### Single qubit MCQFA

Run the following command in the main directory to run single-qubit MCQFA using the default values which were used in the manuscript. The results are saved as a pickle file.


```
python experiments.py single ry
```

You can pass optional arguments to modify default parameters:

```-backend```: IBMQ backend to be used. Type simulator for local simulator and the name for ibmq simulator. Default is belem.
                        
```-p```: p value. Default is 11.

```-length```: Word length until which the simulations will be run. Default is 2 times the word length.

```-shots```: Number of shots. Default is 8192.

```-verbose```: If this option is seleced, output is printed on screen.

Here is another example run:

```
python experiments.py rz single -backend simulator -p 31 -length 5 -shots 1000 -verbose 
```

### Optimized MCQFA

Run the following command in the main directory to run optimized MCQFA:

```
python experiments.py optimized ry
```

The above command runs optimized MCQFA with the implementation using Ry gates, using the default values which were used in the manuscript. The results are saved as pickle file.

In the addition to the optional parameters given above, the following may be provided when running the optimized experiment.

,```-n```: Number of qubits. Default is 3.

```-k```: Set of k values (type by leaving space). Default is 3 5 7. Number of entries should be equal to number of qubits.
